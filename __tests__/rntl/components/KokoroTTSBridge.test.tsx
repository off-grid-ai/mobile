/**
 * KokoroTTSBridge tests — mount gating + delete regression.
 *
 * Regression for the bug where tapping "Remove voice model" silently
 * re-downloaded Kokoro: the outer bridge's shouldLoad flag was one-way (only
 * ever set true), so after a delete the executorch useTextToSpeech hook stayed
 * mounted with preventLoad=false, saw the files gone, and re-fetched the model.
 *
 * The fix makes shouldLoad authoritative (false when the model is absent) and
 * unmounts the inner hook entirely when not loaded — which also frees the
 * ~82 MB model. The executorch hook mock reports isReady immediately, so a
 * mounted inner attaches the bridge and the engine phase becomes 'ready';
 * unmounted, it falls back to 'idle'.
